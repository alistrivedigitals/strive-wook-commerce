Plugin name:   Wook Commerce
Slug:          strive_wookc_

function strive_wookc_deny_product_pirchase(){
     
}
Requirements:
     Develop a plugin to manage popular woocommerce snippet from the backend based on checkbox selection.
     For example:
          There is a snippet in woocommerce to hide Add to Cart button, then that code must be managable from admin side. 
          In admin, need to provide the option to check whether to hide add to cart button on single product page or not
          After saving that settings, if we see single product page then that button must be hidden.

     Create a separate tabs based on snippets like whether the snippet is associated with Cart, checkkout, Single product, etc...

     Every tab will have option with respect to snippet associated with the Woocommerce or Wordpress

     You can use CMB2 for creating admin settings.
